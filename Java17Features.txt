Java 17 features 
1. Pattern Matching using switch statements. Removing boilerplate code and avoid unnessary statements.
	  public String checkShape(Shape shape) {
		return switch (shape) {
			case Triangle t && (t.getNumberOfSides() != 3) -> "This is a weird triangle";
			case Circle c && (c.getNumberOfSides() != 0) -> "This is a weird circle";
			default -> "Just a normal shape";
		};
	}
	
2. Efficient floating point operations which make them strict.

3. Depreciation of Applet API removal.
    Applets API are removed from the Java17. Since many developers are started the carreer using the applets and now the 
	apis are depreciated from Java 9 and this applet version are marked it as removal.
